## Project Overview
This project implements a **Siamese Neural Network** with **EfficientNetB0** backbone for face verification tasks. It compares pairs of facial images to determine if they belong to the same person, achieving **87% accuracy** while being optimized for edge devices.

## Key Features
- 🎭 **Siamese Architecture**: Twin networks with shared weights
- ⚡ **EfficientNetB0**: Lightweight pre-trained feature extractor
- 📏 **L1 Distance Metric**: Computes similarity between embeddings
- 📱 **Edge-Optimized**: 4x fewer parameters than baseline CNN
- 🔄 **Contrastive Learning**: Works with limited labeled data
